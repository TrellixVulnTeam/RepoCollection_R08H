    "In fact, any one of these offsets is fine. Hence, which one should we pick? In fact, all of them are equally good. But if we pick all offsets we end up with rather redundant data due to overlap, particularly if the sequences are long. Picking just a random set of initial positions is no good either since it does not guarantee uniform coverage of the array. For instance, if we pick $n$ elements at random out of a set of $n$ with random replacement, the probability for a particular element not being picked is $(1-1/n)^n \\to e^{-1}$. This means that we cannot expect uniform coverage this way. Even randomly permuting a set of all offsets does not offer good guarantees. Instead we can use a simple trick to get both *coverage* and *randomness*: use a random offset, after which one uses the terms sequentially. We describe how to accomplish this for both random sampling and sequential partitioning strategies below.\n",

    "In random sampling, each example is a sequence arbitrarily captured on the original sequence. The positions of two adjacent random mini-batches on the original sequence are not necessarily adjacent. The target is to predict the next character based on what we've seen so far, hence the labels are the original sequence, shifted by one character. Note that this is not recommended for latent variable models, since we do not have access to the hidden state *prior* to seeing the sequence. We packaged the above code in the `load_data_timemachine` function of the `d2l` package to make it easier to call it in later chapters. It returns four variables: `corpus_indices`, `char_to_idx`, `idx_to_char`, and `vocab_size`."
