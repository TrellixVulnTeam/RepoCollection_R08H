    "LeNet, AlexNet, and VGG all share a common design pattern:\n",
    "extract features exploiting *spatial* structure\n",
    "via a sequence of convolutions and pooling layers\n",
    "and then post-process the representations via fully-connected layers.\n",
    "The improvements upon LeNet by AlexNet and VGG mainly lie\n",
    "in how these later networks widen and deepen these two modules.\n",
    "Alternatively, one could imagine using fully-connected layers\n",
    "earlier in the process.\n",
    "However, a careless use of dense layers might give up the\n",
    "spatial structure of the representation entirely,\n",
    "Network in Network (NiN) blocks offer an alternative.\n",
    "They were proposed by [Lin, Chen and Yan, 2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.4400.pdf) based on a very simple insight---to\n",

    "Also recall that the inputs and outputs of fully-connected layers\n",
    "are typically two-dimensional arrays corresponding to the batch, and features.\n",
    "The idea behind NiN is to apply a fully-connected layer\n",
    "at each pixel location (for each height and  width).\n",
    "If we tie the weights across each spatial location,\n",
    "we could think of this as a $1\\times 1$ convolutional layer\n",
    "(as described in :numref:`chapter_channels`)\n",
    "or as a fully-connected layer acting independently on each pixel location.\n",
    "Another way to view this is to think of each element in the spatial dimension\n",
    "(height and width) as equivalent to an example\n",
    "and the channel as equivalent to a feature.\n",

    "of $11\\times 11$, $5\\times 5$, and $3\\times 3$,\n",

    "Once significant difference between NiN and AlexNet\n",
    "is that NiN avoids dense connections altogether.\n",
    "Instead, NiN uses an NiN block with a number of output channels equal to the number of label classes, followed by a *global* average pooling layer,\n",
    "yielding a vector of [logits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit).\n",
    "One advantage of NiN's design is that it significantly\n",
    "reduces the number of required model parameters.\n",
    "However, in practice, this design sometimes requires\n",
    "increased model training time."

    "\n",
    "* NiN uses blocks consisting of a convolutional layer and multiple $1\\times 1$ convolutional layer. This can be used within the convolutional stack to allow for more per-pixel nonlinearity.\n",
    "* NiN removes the fully connected layers and replaces them with global average pooling (i.e. summing over all locations) after reducing the number of channels to the desired number of outputs (e.g. 10 for Fashion-MNIST).\n",
    "* Removing the dense layers reduces overfitting. NiN has dramatically fewer parameters.\n",
    "* The NiN design influenced many subsequent convolutional neural networks designs.\n",
