    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now ready to put all of the tools together\n",
    "to deploy your first fully-functional convolutional neural network.\n",
    "In our first encounter with image data we applied a multilayer perceptron (:numref:`chapter_mlp_scratch`)\n",
    "to pictures of clothing in the Fashion-MNIST data set.\n",
    "Each image in Fashion-MNIST consisted of\n",
    "a two-dimensional $28 \\times 28$ matrix.\n",
    "To make this data amenable to multilayer perceptrons\n",
    "which anticapte receiving inputs as one-dimensional fixed-length vectors,\n",
    "we first flattened each image, yielding vectors of length 784,\n",
    "before processing them with a series of fully-connected layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have introduced convolutional layers,\n",
    "we can keep the image in its original spatially-organized grid,\n",
    "processing it with a series of successive convolutional layers.\n",
    "Moreover, because we are using convolutional layers,\n",
    "we can enjoy a considerable savings in the number of parameters required.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will introduce one of the first\n",
    "published convolutional neural networks\n",
    "whose benefit was first demonstrated by Yann Lecun,\n",
    "then a researcher at AT&T Bell Labs,\n",
    "for the purpose of recognizing handwritten digits in imagesâ€”[LeNet5](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/).\n",
    "In the 90s, their experiments with LeNet gave the first compelling evidence\n",
    "that it was possible to train convolutional neural networks\n",
    "by backpropagation.\n",
    "Their model achieved outstanding results at the time\n",
    "(only matched by Support Vector Machines at the time)\n",
    "and was adopted to recognize digits for processing deposits in ATM machines.\n",
    "Some ATMs still runn the code\n",
    "that Yann and his colleague Leon Bottou wrote in the 1990s!\n",
    "\n",
    "## LeNet\n",
    "\n",
    "In a rough sense, we can think LeNet as consisting of two parts:\n",
    "(i) a block of convolutional layers; and\n",
    "(ii) a block of fully-connected layers.\n",
    "Before getting into the weeds, let's briefly review the model in :numref:`img_lenet`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Data flow in LeNet 5. The input is a handwritten digit, the output a probabilitiy over 10 possible outcomes.](../img/lenet.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    ":label:`img_lenet`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic units in the convolutional block are a convolutional layer\n",
    "and a subsequent average pooling layer\n",
    "(note that max-pooling works better,\n",
    "but it had not been invented in the 90s yet).\n",
    "The convolutional layer is used to recognize\n",
    "the spatial patterns in the image,\n",
    "such as lines and the parts of objects,\n",
    "and the subsequent average pooling layer\n",
    "is used to reduce the dimensionality.\n",
    "The convolutional layer block is composed of\n",
    "repeated stacks of these two basic units.\n",
    "Each convolutional layer uses a $5\\times 5$ kernel\n",
    "and processes each output with a sigmoid activation function\n",
    "(again, note that ReLUs are now known to work more reliably,\n",
    "but had not been invented yet).\n",
    "The first convolutional layer has 6 output channels,\n",
    "and second convolutional layer increases channel depth further to 16.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, coinciding with this increase in the number of channels,\n",
    "the height and width are shrunk considerably.\n",
    "Therefore, increasing the number of output channels\n",
    "makes the parameter sizes of the two convolutional layers similar.\n",
    "The two average pooling layers are of size $2\\times 2$ and take stride 2\n",
    "(note that this means they are non-overlapping).\n",
    "In other words, the pooling layer downsamples the representation\n",
    "to be precisely *one quarter* the pre-pooling size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolutional block emits an output with size given by\n",
    "(batch size, channel, height, width).\n",
    "Before we can pass the convolutional block's output\n",
    "to the fully-connected block, we must flatten\n",
    "each example in the mini-batch.\n",
    "In other words, we take this 4D input and tansform it into the 2D\n",
    "input expected by fully-connected layers:\n",
    "as a reminder, the first dimension indexes the examples in the mini-batch\n",
    "and the second gives the flat vector representation of each example.\n",
    "LeNet's fully-connected layer block has three fully-connected layers,\n",
    "with 120, 84, and 10 outputs, respectively.\n",
    "Because we are still performing classification,\n",
    "the 10 dimensional output layer corresponds\n",
    "to the number of possible output classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "While getting to the point\n",
    "where you truly understand\n",
    "what's going on inside LeNet\n",
    "may have taken a bit of work,\n",
    "you can see below that implementing it\n",
    "in a modern deep learning library\n",
    "is remarkably simple.\n",
    "Again, we'll rely on the Sequential class."
